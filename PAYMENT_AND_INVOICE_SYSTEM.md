## Database Migrations

### Migration File: `006_invoices_table.sql`
Creates the invoices table and related indexes for performance optimization.

## API Endpoints

]
```

## Frontend Integration

### API Service Functions

**File:** `frontend/src/services/api.js`

```javascript
// Create membership payment
createMembershipPayment(payload)

// Fetch all invoices
getUserInvoices()

// Fetch specific invoice
getInvoiceDetails(invoiceId)

// Fetch payment transactions
getUserPaymentTransactions()
```

### Component Updates

**File:** `frontend/src/components/subscriptions/SubscriptionPanel.jsx`

- Displays pricing plans with selection
- Shows payment review before completing checkout
- Displays transaction history from database
- Properly formats amounts from paise to rupees

## Invoice Generation

### Invoice Number Format
- Format: `INV-YYYYMMDD-XXXX`
- Example: `INV-20260613-1234`
- Guarantees uniqueness per day with random 4-digit suffix

### Auto-Generated Invoice Data
When a payment is created, the system automatically:
1. Generates unique invoice number
2. Creates membership record with dates
3. Records payment transaction with provider info
4. Creates invoice with status 'paid'
5. All within a single atomic database transaction

## Data Flow

```
User Selects Plan
    ↓
Reviews Payment Details
    ↓
Completes Checkout (onPay)
    ↓
API: POST /memberships/payments
    ↓
Backend Transaction:
  - Create membership
  - Create payment_transaction
  - Create invoice
  - Commit all or rollback
    ↓
Response with all records
    ↓
Frontend: Update subscription state + localStorage
    ↓
Display success & update transaction history
```

## Amount Storage

All amounts are stored in **paise** (100 paise = 1 rupee) to avoid floating-point precision issues:

```javascript
// Conversion
amountPaise = amount * 100
amountRupees = amountPaise / 100
```

## Transaction Safety

Payment operations use database transactions to ensure atomicity:
- If any step fails, entire transaction is rolled back
- No partial payment records are created
- Consistent state guaranteed

## Error Handling

The system handles common errors:
- Invalid payment data (validation with Zod)
- Database constraint violations
- Missing required fields
- Authorization failures (user ownership validation)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real Payment Gateway Integration**
   - Razorpay, PayPal, Stripe
   - Webhook handling for payment confirmations
   - Automatic invoice updates on payment completion

2. **Invoice Features**
   - PDF generation and download
   - Email delivery
   - Invoice tracking status (sent, viewed, etc.)
   - Recurring invoice automation

3. **Refund Management**
   - Partial refunds
   - Refund reason tracking
   - Automatic membership cancellation

4. **Financial Reports**
   - Revenue analytics
   - Payment trend analysis
   - Tax reporting exports
