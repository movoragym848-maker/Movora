# Gym Registration & Owner Members Management - Complete Implementation Guide

## 🎯 Feature Overview

This system implements a complete gym registration and member management workflow:

1. **Gym Owner Registration** → Gym auto-registered in `registered_gyms` database
2. **User Registration** → Users select from registered gyms, system validates gym exists
3. **Members Tab** → Gym owners see all members from their gym when logged in

## 🔄 Complete User Flows

### Flow 1: Gym Owner Registration

}
↓
✅ Creates gym_owners record

## 🎨 Frontend Implementation

### User Signup Flow

**File**: [frontend/src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx](frontend/src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx)

```jsx
// 1. Fetch registered gyms when user switches to signup
useEffect(() => {
  if (mode === "signup") {
    getRegisteredGyms()
      .then(gyms => setRegisteredGyms(gyms))
  }
}, [mode]);

// 2. Display gym list as datalist
<AuthInput 
  label="Gym Name" 
  value={form.gymName} 
  list="gyms-list"
/>
<datalist id="gyms-list">
  {registeredGyms.map(gym => (
    <option key={gym} value={gym} />
  ))}
</datalist>

// 3. Validate gym exists before signup
const checkRes = await checkGym(form.gymName);
const exactGymName = checkRes.gymName; // Use official name
```

### Gym Owner Dashboard

**File**: [frontend/src/components/gym-owner/GymOwnerDashboard.jsx](frontend/src/components/gym-owner/GymOwnerDashboard.jsx)

```jsx
// 1. Load members on component mount
useEffect(() => {
  const membersData = await getGymMembers();
  setMembers(membersData);
}, []);

// 2. Calculate statistics
const totalMembers = members.length;
const activeMembers = members.filter(m => m.status === "active").length;
const expiredMembers = members.filter(m => m.status === "expired").length;

// 3. Filter members by search
const filteredMembers = members.filter(m => 
  m.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
  m.plan?.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);

// 4. Display with expiry alerts
{members.map(member => (
  <tr key={member.user_id}>
    <td>{member.name}</td>
    <td>{member.plan}</td>
    <td>{member.days_remaining} days</td>
    <td>{member.status}</td>
  </tr>
))}
```

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

### Access Control

```javascript
// Gym Owner Auth Check (auth.js middleware)
if (req.user.role !== "gym_owner") {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: "Gym owner role required" });
}

// JWT Token includes:
{
  sub: gymOwner.id,
  email: gymOwner.email,
  role: "gym_owner"
}
```

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Gym Owner Registration

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/gym-owners/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "gymName": "Test Gym",
    "phone": "9999999999",
    "email": "test@gym.com",
    "password": "password123",
    "city": "Delhi"
  }'
```

**Expected**: 
- ✅ Gym owner created with status "pending"
- ✅ Gym auto-registered in `registered_gyms`
- ✅ WhatsApp notification sent to admin

### 2. Test User Registration

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "phone": "8888888888",
    "password": "password123",
    "gymName": "Test Gym"
  }'
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Validates "Test Gym" exists

curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/gym-owners/members \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <gym_owner_access_token>"
```

**Expected**:
- ✅ Returns array of users with that gym
- ✅ Includes membership details and days remaining
- ✅ Sorted by expiry_date DESC

### 4. Test Get Registered Gyms

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:4000/api/auth/gyms
```
