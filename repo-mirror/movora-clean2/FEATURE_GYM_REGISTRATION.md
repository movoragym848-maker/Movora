## System Architecture

### Database Schema

```sql
registered_gyms:
  id (UUID)
  name (text, UNIQUE)
  city (text)
  gym_owner_id (UUID) → gym_owners.id
  created_at

users:
  ...existing fields...
  gym_name (text) → registered_gyms.name

gym_owners:
  id, gym_name, city, email, phone, status...
```

### Data Flow

```
Gym Owner Signup
    ↓
✓ Create gym_owner record
✓ Auto-insert to registered_gyms
✓ Gym now available for users to join

User Signup
    ↓
✓ Check if gym_name exists in registered_gyms
✓ If not found → Error
✓ If found → Create user with exact gym name
✓ User now appears in gym owner's members list

Gym Owner Login
    ↓
✓ Get user's gym_name from gym_owners table
✓ Query all users with matching gym_name
✓ Get their latest membership details
✓ Display with revenue, stats, expiry alerts
```

## Frontend Implementation

### User Signup Component

**File**: `frontend/src/components/auth/AuthScreen.jsx`

Features:
- ✅ Fetches registered gyms on signup mode
- ✅ Shows gym dropdown/datalist for autocomplete
- ✅ Validates gym before signup
- ✅ Shows OTP verification flow

```jsx
// Fetch gyms
useEffect(() => {
  if (mode === "signup") {
    getRegisteredGyms()
      .then(gyms => setRegisteredGyms(gyms))
  }
}, [mode]);

// Display datalist
<datalist id="gyms-list">
  {registeredGyms.map(gym => (
    <option key={gym} value={gym} />
  ))}
</datalist>

// Validate gym
const checkRes = await checkGym(form.gymName);
const exactGymName = checkRes.gymName; // Use official name
```

### Gym Owner Dashboard

**File**: `frontend/src/components/gym-owner/GymOwnerDashboard.jsx`

Features:
- ✅ Displays all members in table format
- ✅ Shows member stats (total, active, expired)
- ✅ Search and filter members
- ✅ Shows days until expiry
- ✅ Send reminders to members
- ✅ View payment history by month

```jsx
// Load members
useEffect(() => {
  const membersData = await getGymMembers();
  setMembers(membersData);
}, []);

// Calculate stats
const totalMembers = members.length;
const activeMembers = members.filter(m => m.status === "active").length;
const expiredMembers = members.filter(m => m.status === "expired").length;

// Filter members
const filteredMembers = members.filter(m => 
  m.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase())
);

// Display with expiry alerts
{members.map(member => (
  <tr key={member.user_id}>
    <td>{member.name}</td>
    <td>{member.plan}</td>
    <td className={member.days_remaining < 7 ? "alert" : ""}>
      {member.days_remaining} days
    </td>
  </tr>
))}
```

### API Integration

**File**: `frontend/src/services/api.js`

```javascript
export const getRegisteredGyms = () => request("/auth/gyms");
export const checkGym = name => request(`/auth/check-gym?name=${encodeURIComponent(name)}`);
export const getGymMembers = () => request("/gym-owners/members");
export const sendMemberReminder = payload => 
  request("/gym-owners/send-reminder", { method:"POST", body:JSON.stringify(payload) });
```

## Backend Implementation

### Gym Owner Controller

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/gymOwnerController.js`

Key Functions:
- `signupGymOwner()` - Register gym owner and auto-register gym
- `getGymMembers()` - Get all members for gym owner's gym
- `getGymRevenue()` - Calculate revenue from members
- `sendMemberReminder()` - Send WhatsApp reminder

```javascript
export async function signupGymOwner(req, res, next) {
  // 1. Validate gym name not duplicate
  // 2. Start transaction
  // 3. Create gym owner
  // 4. Auto-insert gym to registered_gyms
  // 5. Commit or rollback
}

export async function getGymMembers(req, res, next) {
  // 1. Check user role is gym_owner
  // 2. Get gym owner's gym_name
  // 3. Find all users with matching gym_name
  // 4. Join with latest membership
  // 5. Calculate days_remaining
  // 6. Sort by expiry_date DESC
  // 7. Return array
}
```

### Auth Controller

**File**: `backend/src/controllers/authController.js`

Key Functions:
- `signup()` - Register user with gym validation
- `getRegisteredGyms()` - List all registered gyms
- `checkGymRegistered()` - Validate single gym

```javascript
export async function signup(req, res, next) {
  // 1. Get gym name from request
  // 2. Query: SELECT name FROM registered_gyms WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER(?)
  // 3. If not found → return 400 error
  // 4. If found → use officialGymName from DB
  // 5. Create user with officialGymName
}

export async function getRegisteredGyms(req, res, next) {
  // Query: SELECT name FROM registered_gyms ORDER BY name
  // Return array of gym names
}
```

### Auth Middleware

**File**: `backend/src/middleware/auth.js`

```javascript
export function requireAuth(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.slice(7);
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: "Missing token" });
  try {
    req.user = jwt.verify(token, env.jwtAccessSecret);
    next();
  } catch {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: "Invalid token" });
  }
}
```

Access control for gym owners:
```javascript
if (req.user.role !== "gym_owner") {
  return res.status(403).json({ message: "Gym owner role required" });
}
```

---

## Security Features

✅ **Role-based access control** - Only gym owners can access member endpoints
✅ **Data isolation** - Gym owners only see their gym's members
✅ **Gym name case-insensitivity** - Prevents duplicate gyms
✅ **Transactional consistency** - Gym owner + gym registration atomic
✅ **Email/Phone uniqueness** - No duplicate accounts
✅ **Password hashing** - bcrypt with 12 rounds

---

## Testing

### Manual Test Steps

1. **Create Gym Owner**
   ```bash
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/gym-owners/signup
   {
     "gymName": "Test Gym",
     "phone": "9999999999",
     "email": "test@gym.com",
     "password": "test123",
     "city": "Delhi"
   }
   ```

2. **Check Gym is Registered**
   ```bash
   GET http://localhost:4000/api/auth/check-gym?name=Test%20Gym
   ```

3. **Create User in that Gym**
   ```bash
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/auth/signup
   {
     "name": "Test User",
     "email": "user@test.com",
     "phone": "8888888888",
     "password": "user123",
     "gymName": "Test Gym"
   }
   ```

4. **Gym Owner Logs In and Views Members**
   ```bash
   POST http://localhost:4000/api/gym-owners/login
   GET http://localhost:4000/api/gym-owners/members
   ```

### Automated Tests

```bash
cd backend
node verify-gym-registration.js
```

Tests:
- ✓ Health check
- ✓ Get registered gyms
- ✓ Register gym owner
- ✓ Verify gym is registered
- ✓ Register user with valid gym
- ✓ Reject user with invalid gym
- ✓ Get gym members

## Error Handling

### User-Facing Errors

| Scenario | HTTP Status | Message |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Gym not found | 400 | "This gym is not registered with us. Please enter a registered gym." |
| Duplicate email | 409 | "Account already exists with this email or phone." |
| Invalid credentials | 401 | "Invalid email or password." |
| Gym owner pending | 403 | "Approval pending. You will get a call within 24 hours..." |
| Unauthorized access | 403 | "Access forbidden. Gym owner role required." |

## Database Migrations

The feature uses these migrations:

1. **001_initial_schema.sql** - Creates users table with gym_name field
2. **002_gym_owner_accounts.sql** - Creates gym_owners table
3. **004_gym_owner_refresh_tokens.sql** - Creates refresh tokens for gym owners
4. **005_registered_gyms.sql** - **Creates registered_gyms table** and adds gym_name to users

Key SQL:
```sql
CREATE TABLE registered_gyms (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name text UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  city text NOT NULL,
  gym_owner_id uuid REFERENCES gym_owners(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS gym_name text;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_users_gym_name ON users(gym_name);
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set environment variables in `.env`
- [ ] Test gym owner signup
- [ ] Test user signup with gym validation
- [ ] Test get members endpoint
- [ ] Verify WhatsApp notifications working
- [ ] Test OTP verification flow
- [ ] Load test with multiple gyms
- [ ] Test revenue calculations

## Performance Optimization

### Indexes Created
- `idx_users_gym_name` - Fast lookup of users by gym
- `idx_gym_owners_city` - Fast city-based queries

### Query Optimization
- Uses DISTINCT ON to get latest membership per user
- Calculates days_remaining efficiently with PostgreSQL functions
- Sorts results in database, not in application

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Bulk member import
- [ ] Member analytics dashboard
- [ ] Automated billing reminders
- [ ] Member feedback/surveys
- [ ] Trainer assignment
- [ ] Class scheduling
- [ ] QR code check-in
- [ ] Mobile app for members
