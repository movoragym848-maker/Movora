# 🏋️ Gym Registration & Owner Members Management - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Feature Complete & Production Ready

This is a complete implementation of a gym registration and member management system for the Movora SaaS platform.

---

## 📋 What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Database Layer (Migrations)
- ✅ `registered_gyms` table - Central registry of all gyms
- ✅ `gym_owners` table - Gym owner accounts with verification status
- ✅ `gym_owner_refresh_tokens` - Session management for gym owners
- ✅ `users.gym_name` - Link users to their gym
- ✅ Proper indexes on gym_name for fast queries
- ✅ Foreign key relationships with cascading deletes

### 2. Backend API
- ✅ **Public Endpoints:**
  - `GET /auth/gyms` - List all registered gyms
  - `GET /auth/check-gym?name=...` - Validate gym registration
  - `POST /auth/signup` - User registration with gym validation
  - `POST /gym-owners/signup` - Gym owner registration (auto-registers gym)

- ✅ **Protected Endpoints (Gym Owner):**
  - `GET /gym-owners/members` - Get all members of gym owner's gym
  - `GET /gym-owners/revenue` - Revenue statistics
  - `POST /gym-owners/send-reminder` - Send member reminders via WhatsApp
  - `GET /gym-owners/payments` - Monthly payment history

### 3. Frontend Components
- ✅ **Auth Screen** - User signup with gym selection dropdown
- ✅ **Gym Owner Dashboard** - Members tab showing:
  - Member names and phone numbers
  - Active membership plans
  - Start and expiry dates
  - Days remaining until expiry
  - Status (active/expired)
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Member statistics
  - Send reminders functionality

### 4. Core Logic
- ✅ Gym owner signup automatically registers gym
- ✅ User signup validates gym exists
- ✅ Gym names are case-insensitive but stored case-exact
- ✅ Gym owners only see members from their gym
- ✅ Members sorted by expiry date (soon expiring first)
- ✅ Days remaining calculated automatically
- ✅ Role-based access control (only gym_owner role can access /gym-owners/members)

## 📈 Database Schema

```sql
registered_gyms:
  - id (UUID)
  - name (text, UNIQUE)
  - city (text)
  - gym_owner_id (FK → gym_owners.id)
  - created_at

gym_owners:
  - id, gym_name, email, phone, city
  - status (pending/active/paused/disabled)
  - password_hash, last_login_at, created_at

users:
  - id, name, email, phone, gym_name (→ registered_gyms.name)
  - role, created_at, deleted_at

memberships:
  - id, user_id, gym_name, plan_label
  - start_date, expiry_date, status, amount_paise
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Create gym owner → Gym is auto-registered
2. Try user signup with that gym → Should succeed
3. Try user signup with non-existent gym → Should fail
4. Gym owner logs in → Can see members
5. Members show correct data and sorting

### Automated Testing
```bash
cd backend
node verify-gym-registration.js
```

## 📊 Performance Notes

- Gym lookups: O(1) with index on gym.name
- Member queries: O(n) with n = members in gym (indexed by gym_name)
